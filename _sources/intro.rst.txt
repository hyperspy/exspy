Welcome to the documentation of eXSpy!
**************************************
**eXSpy** is a Python package extending the functionality for multi-dimensional
data analysis provided by the `HyperSpy <https://hyperspy.org/>`_ library. It is
aimed at helping with the analysis of X-rays Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS)
and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS).

Check out the :ref:`installation <install-label>` section for further information,
including how to start using this project.

.. note::

   This is an open-source community project: everyone is welcome to contribute.
   Please read our (see :ref:`contributing_label`) guidelines and get started!
