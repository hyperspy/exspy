DOSE_DOC = """beam_current : float or "auto"
            Probe current in nA.
            If "auto", the value is extracted from the metadata.
            Only for ``"zeta"`` and ``"cross_section"`` method.
        live_time : float or "auto"
            Acquisition time in s, compensated for the dead time of the detector.
            If "auto", the value is extracted from the metadata.
            Only for ``"zeta"`` and ``"cross_section"`` method.
        probe_area : float or "auto"
            The illumination area of the electron beam in nmÂ².
            If ``"auto"`` the value is extracted from the scale axes_manager,
            assuming that the probe is oversampling such that the illumination
            area can be approximated to the pixel area of the spectrum image.
            Only for the ``"cross_section"`` method."""
