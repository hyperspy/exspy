DOSE_DOC = """beam_current : float or "auto"
            Probe current in nA.
            If "auto", the value is extracted from the metadata.
            Only for ``"zeta"`` and ``"cross_section"`` method.
        live_time : float or "auto"
            Acquisition time in s, compensated for the dead time of the detector.
            If "auto", the value is extracted from the metadata.
            Only for ``"zeta"`` and ``"cross_section"`` method.
        probe_area : float or "auto"
            The illumination area of the electron beam in nmÂ².
            If ``"auto"`` the value is extracted from the scale axes_manager,
            assuming that the probe is oversampling such that the illumination
            area can be approximated to the pixel area of the spectrum image.
            Only for the ``"cross_section"`` method."""

INTENSITIES_THRESHOLD_DOC = """intensities_threshold : float, optional
        Threshold value used to set individual intensity values to zero when they
        fall below this threshold. This helps filter out noise and very low
        intensity peaks. If <= 0, no individual intensity thresholding is applied.
        Default is 1.0."""


INTENSITIES_SUM_THRESHOLD_DOC = """intensities_sum_threshold : int, float or None, optional
        Threshold value used to set output values to zero in areas with very low
        X-ray intensities, such as vacuum areas. If the sum of the
        intensities falls below this threshold, the output is set to zero.
        If None, the length of the intensities list is used as the threshold.
        Default is None."""
