DOSE_DOC = """beam_current : float or "auto"
            Probe current in nA.
            If "auto", the value is extracted from the metadata.
            Only for ``"zeta"`` and ``"cross_section"`` method.
        live_time : float or "auto"
            Acquisition time in s, compensated for the dead time of the detector.
            If "auto", the value is extracted from the metadata.
            Only for ``"zeta"`` and ``"cross_section"`` method.
        probe_area : float or "auto"
            The illumination area of the electron beam in nmÂ².
            If ``"auto"`` the value is extracted from the scale axes_manager,
            assuming that the probe is oversampling such that the illumination
            area can be approximated to the pixel area of the spectrum image.
            Only for the ``"cross_section"`` method."""


WEIGHT_THRESHOLD_PARAMETER = """weight_threshold : float
        Define the threshold of the weight below which the lines are
        ignored. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.1."""


ENERGY_RANGE_PARAMETER = """energy_range : list or tuple of length 2
        Define the start and the end of the x-ray energy to consider.
        X-ray energy outside the range will be ignored. If ``None``,
        all x-ray energy are considered. Default is None."""


WIDTH_PARAMETER = """width : float
        Window width in keV around energy in which to find nearby energies,
        i.e. a value of 0.1 keV (the default) means to search +/- 0.05 keV."""


ONLY_LINES_PARAMETER = """only_lines : list of str, optional
        Define the lines to be considered (eg. ('a','Kb')).
        If None, all lines are included. Default is None."""


SORTING_PARAMETER = """sorting : str
        Define the sorting of the table, either ``"elements"`` or ``"energy"``.
        Default is ``"elements"``."""


FLOAT_FORMAT_PARAMETER = """float_format : str
        The formatting of the float in the table passed to
        :class:`prettytable.PrettyTable`. Default is ".2"."""
